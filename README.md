### Bubble Sort: 
#### Best Case: Ascending Order
- When the list is already sorted in ascending order, there is only 1 pass with no swaps.
- Runtime complexity: 1

#### Worst Case: Descending Order
- When the list is in descending order (opposite of what we want), then we have to make n passes with n^2 swaps.
- Runtime complexity: n^2

### SelectionSort
#### Best Case: None
#### Worst Case: None
- There is no best/worst case because selection sort only swaps once per pass, and there's always n-1 passes. 
- Runtime complexity: n

### InsertionSort
#### Best Case: Ascending Order
- When the list is already sorted in ascending order, there is only 1 pass with no swaps.
- Runtime complexity: 1
#### Worst Case: Descending Order
- When the list is in descending order (opposite of what we want), then we have to make n passes with n^2 swaps.
- Runtime complexity: n^2
